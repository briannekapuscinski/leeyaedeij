FL Studio является дорожечным (паттерн) секвенсором, где создание музыки происходит в Piano Roll, Step Sequencer и затем осуществляется составление всей композиции из отдельных частей в окне Playlist. MIXING & EFFECTS. Fruity Limiter + Compressor + Gate. The Fruity Limiter is a powerful single band Compressor (with sidechain), Limiter & Gate.To access the relevant limiter and compressor controls, switch between LIMIT and COMP tabs on the plugin interface (as shown below). We believe you should test everything FL Studio and plugins have to offer before you hand over any money, and for as long as you want. For that reason the download FL Studio installer gives you Signature Bundle plus most of our additional plugin instruments & effects in a single installer. I've been screeing around with mastering this track a couple hours a day for like a week and a half can't get it right found maximizer present on fruity multiband compressor, made slight adjustments it was the best decision I made yet --- even better then the YouTube tutorial I watched teaching me how to use it idk is that a good idea pls don't hit me with the "if it sounds good then blah blah blah " I'm really trying to get my technical side down and I am trying to cut out as much amateur.

I have been a user of cracked FL for a while (sorry IL and everyone!). But now for the first time in my life I have a job that pays enough for me to feasibly afford this type of stuff. I'm happy to spend the money on the "producer edition", but I have some worries. I was perusing this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/2lvk2b/if_i_buy_fl_studio_legitimately_can_i_still_use/) and I'll be honest - I shared some of this guy's concerns. I still can't afford to spend almost FL Studio (formerly known as FruityLoops) is a digital audio workstation developed by the Belgian company Image-Line.FL Studio features a graphical user interface based on a pattern-based music sequencer. On my master channel I have a Fruity Multiband Compressor and Ozone 4. On all of my individual channels, I have added a Fruity Parametric eq 2 that cuts at 20hz and 18khz. All of my instruments, when played individually, do not seem to display any frequency info out of the range (when looking at a frequency analyzer in "Wave Candy"). Without Ozone on, the same goes for my master channel. But when I turn it on, my Wave Candy begins to look like this: I can't put another. 
I was giving FL 12 a shot on a Macbook Pro (mid-2014, windows 8.1 bootcamp) and had the same issue as a lot of people with VST's that are far too small due to the scaling; even some native plugins like Fruity Multiband Compressor are nearly microscopic. The bridging trick worked for some of the 3rd party VST's, but not all, and I couldn't fix the native plugin issues. Does anyone know if Image-Line has plans to fix this issue? I reaaaally want to use FL 12, but for now I am unfortunately reverti.

I’m trying to base my Multibrand Compressions and Saturation around Maximus having known that The Soundgoodizer is essentially Maximus, and Maximus is a really good multiband compresser, I’m just wondering if there’s a way I can emulate an OTT in Maximus Thank you :) Sorry for bad English. EZmix 2 is a multi-effect plug-in that lets you assign professionally designed audio processing effect chains to any audio source. A guitar amp, mixing engineer and mastering suite all in one convenient package. I'm a beginner when it comes to electronic music, having mostly played in bands and not having to worry about mixing myself, so I apologize if the answer might be obvious. I'm looking to get both the great stereo width and the lack of low end that these two examples have. Example 1 (https://itemshop.bandcamp.com/track/shoe-store) Example 2 (https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/track/aisle-1-earth-tones-rectangles-and-fake-plants). 프로그램에서 기본으로 제공하는 내장악기(3xOSC, Sytrus 등)가 꽤 많다. 그게 그냥 구색 맞추기로 넣어놓은 게 아니고 그 자체로 퀄리티가 충분한 곡을 완성할 수 있을 정도로 대부분 성능이 괜찮고 8 9 양도 제법 많은 편이다.외부 VSTi(가상악기)플러그인도 호환이 가능하다. combover is a comb delay, and four more comb delays, and a step sequencer that does odd things, and a pool of prime numbers that make stuff happen, and some mix n match pitch detection. So uh. Serum. That thing. If you don't know, the multiband setting on the compressor is actually an upward compressor(as in the quieter sounds get boosted to a threshold, comes in handy if you want that reverb). Is this possible with FL's stock effects. Is there a way to link the kick to a high-pass filter on a bass to "compress" the low spectrum on the bass? I saw this mentioned in an Infected Mushroom interview and I'm nuts about their sound, Erez mentioned he made a plugin that would high pass his bass on the kick. Is there a way to do this with macros (?)/Control Surface/something. There has been a piece of advice lately thrown around especially around the trap genre in beatmaking communities, how the "volume amplifier" knob under the wrenchtool of a sound in FL Studio is a preamp and how you can use it to boost your sounds and make them "hit harder", usually the drums. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's tutorials like this that are misleading thousands of people: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbZH4g83ESE (and I would have linked another video by Chukki. I'm trying to get my beats as loud as this on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEc5eZFA\_8 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEc5eZFA_8) But I won't sound that hard for some reason when I upload it to YouTube. In FL it sounds good and when I export it, it sounds good too. Even when I edit my video and render it (with recommened audio settings for YouTube) to me it sounds pretty nice. I've literally tried everything. I took off fruity limiter on the mixer track and I've added. 
How do you make your tracks commercially loud when exporting? I've gone through numerous tuts on leveling and making your drums knock but even at 0dB, with either Fruity Limiter, Multiband Compressor or Maximus on the master channel, upon export the beat's still super low compared to other people's tracks—even with my track being well leveled and EQ'd. I just don't know what I'm missing to get that same quality as DJ Pain 1, CashmoneyAPs and others.﻿ There has to be something done to the render. When do I use it, and when I actually open a fruity compressor or a multiband compressor, what knobs should I adjust and what am I aiming for? First learned song structure and composition but starting to learn mixing and stuff. 2 Months ago I had a problem with supersaws,they didnt sound as wide and open as the pro's were making them.That got me into research and now I make spectacular ones,even better than the pro's. So I decided to share my knowledge in case anyone is having a difficult time. Tip1: Make sure that your saw in osc.a is less detuned that the second one.The knob should be around 8 o'clock,while at the 2nd it should be anywhere from 9 to 12 (Depending on the number of voices) Tip2: Use Serum (They sound. I really quite like all the stock plugins of FL studio, except for the compressor. I was wondering if anyone would have a good cheap (or free) suggestion for a compressor. If you look at a site like Splice, there are loads of free products to find, but not so many compressors besides OTT (which I do have, but I really want to get a better grasp on compression before diving into multiband). I kinda got lost in the questions on this sub about free compressors, so I decided to make my own post. I wrote up some stuff earlier that /u/1_of_the_yard-wolves wanted to put on the sidebar but I didn't think it was in depth enough so I've decided to add to it I'm not an expert by any means but I like to think I have some more insight and experience than your normal run of the mill bedroom producer. Background: I have a degree in audio engineering, have practical experience recording and mixing full band and individual artist projects and I have worked in professional studio spaces. This doesn'. 
Multiband compression is a useful tool. With 3 bands, you can separately change the dynamics of the bass, mids and highs. With 5 bands, you can level out the overall sound. But i was curious, what happens when you take it way too fucking far? Well, you actually get a really useful tool - something that will flatten the frequency spectrum when the music is at it's loudest, without significantly affecting the dynamics. When the music is quiet, the frequency spectrum is largely unaffected. Instead. Hey guys! Been producing for a while right now in FL Studio. My main focus is in sampling (not just this classic soulful-jazzy-funky stuff, but modern genres and bands -com truise, sunny day real state, and a lot of different stuff). But imma start with my first basic questions: -How do you find the key of a sample (The principal one) so you can tune your drums/complementary sounds to that keys? -In some cases, samples i take, although being of a short duration, change volume I tried to isolate synths for a trap remix of Welcome To The Jungle, but it ended up sounding really bad, and was wondering if anyone had a better way to do it? I've uploaded 2 parts ( to Zippyshare, both unedited and edited, so you can hear how bad I messed up and what would be the better way to do it. What I've tried so far is messing with Fruity Parametric EQ 2, and Multiband Compressor. http://www62.zippyshare.com/v/ww9A2rp5/file.html. Hi r/watmm! I'm fairly new to the music scene and I've recently started experimenting with recording and mixing some things. Now I understand what compression does for a track, and I've done research, but once I see threshold and ratio and all that, my understanding goes out the window. I don't even have a hope in the world of utilizing a multiband compressor and I can only slightly improve my tracks with the compressor built into the Fruity Limiter in FL studio through messing I hope this isn't the wrong place to post this or a completely daft question. I've been tidying up folders on my PC, and I have a full of over 1GB of audio software someone copied me years ago. It seems to date from 1998-2001. Can anyone tell me is this stuff worth hanging onto, or is it so far out of date now I should just delete the lot? I'm not actively involved in making music right now but I might want to try my hand later on. I DJ mix and I have a big project to rip all my vinyl to digita. EDIT: ~SOLVED~ I clicked the settings for the compressor plugin (cog logo at the top left) and the "processing" tab showed "input 1" and "input 2," and I assumed input 2 would be the "ext. signal" so I right clicked and chose my kick as that input. Now it's working as expected. Thanks again to /u/jesuswantsbrains. I'm trying to sidechain my kick to a bassline, and I'm working in Fruity Loops. I'm using 5ORCERY multiband compressor. I'm trying to sidechain the kick to the bass track What would you suggest for new features in fl 12 updates ? I am looking for some good ideas so I can pitch everything to image line at once. Here is what I am hoping for so far : -New ms(milliseconds) display for the axes in the fruity envelope controller and in every fl studio synth for the volume envelope etc. so we can have an actual idea of what is going on.This would be super useful too in conjunction of compressors because the envelope would tell a real time volume change in ms -Visual.
